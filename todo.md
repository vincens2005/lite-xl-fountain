# Things to add
- name autofill
- italics etc.
- linewrapping
- "open as script" in treeview context menu

# Things to fix
- Prefixes and postfixes have to be rendered because otherwise the caret gets screwed up
- caret position on first character of prefixed line looks a little funny
- messy code lmao
